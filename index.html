                    <p>
                        Dog Guides give freedom and independence to people who are blind, have low vision or
                        other impairments. They help people to get around safely and confidently. They also make
                        wonderful companions.

                    <p>
                        <li>Speak directly to the person, not the dog, when offering assistance.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Keep pathways clear of obstacles and overhanging bushes trimmed to fence line.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Leave doors fully open or fully closed.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Position yourself slightly behind the right shoulder of a dog handler
                            when walking with them.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>If the handler is instructing their dog to "follow", walk about 1 metre ahead and continue
                            talking to the handler.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Alert the person to any unusual behaviour or physical appearance
                            of their dog.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Be calm and soft when interacting with a Dog Guide.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Offer assistance (if required) to a dog

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        <li>Distract, feed or touch a working Seeing Eye Dog (in
                            harness) without the handler’s permission.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Discriminate against a person because they are
                            using a dog guide.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Pet or talk to a Dog Guide without
                            permission from the handler. If the handler
                            declines to allow the interaction, respect
                            the decision. Some dogs can easily develop
                            the habit of seeking out the attention of
                            others and losing focus on their partner.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>“Flirt” with a Dog Guide; making
                            kissing noises, whistling at, or trying
                            to entice a dog over are all
                            inappropriate actions and will not be
                            appreciated by the handler.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Offer food or treats to a Dog
                            Guide. Guide dogs are often trained
                            using food as a motivational tool
                            and positive reinforcement from the
                            handler, and should only receive
                            food from the handler. Dog Guide
                            diets are also particular; feeding
                            them people food can cause illness
                            in the dog.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Allow pets, including
                            other dogs, to approach a Dog
                            Guide team for any reason,
                            whether they are friendly or
                            not. While many people may see
                            this as an opportunity for dogs
                            to just say hello to each other,
                            it is distracting to the team
                            and can ambush a blind handler.
                            Guide dogs need to retain their
                            training of ignoring other dogs
                            and animals while working.</li>

                            person
                            without the aid of a dog. For example, the dog picks up dropped items, empties
                            washing
                            machines, gives warning when smoke alarms sound.<br><br>

                            Braziliero, Dogo Argentino, Presa Canario, American Pit Bull).<br><br>
                            • The dog must be of sound temperament. If this is in doubt, then a
                            recognised temperament test e.g. National Consultative Committee for Animal
                            Welfare or
                            SAFER, should be undertaken by a person familiar with the test.<br><br>

                            which is
                            covered by the Board)<br><br>
                            • The dog must observe any conditions if so specified by the Dog and Cat
                            Management
                            Board.<br><br>

                            Evidence Required<br><br>

                            Practitioner and a Specialist who are treating the person, stating both the
                            illness and
                            details of the disability and whether or not a dog would assist with activities
                            of daily
                            living.<br><br>
                            • Dog must be assessed for its temperament and capabilities by the

                            The Anti-Discrimination Act covers discrimination against guide, hearing and

                            dogs.<br><br>

                            21. Discrimination by refusing to allow Dog Guide, &c.<br><br>

                            (1) For the purposes of this Act, a person discriminates on the ground of
                            impairment
                            against a person with a visual, hearing or mobility impairment if the person
                            treats the
                            person with the impairment less favourably because the person has a guide

                            (2) Subsection (1) applies notwithstanding that it is the practice of the person
                            to
                            treat less favourably other persons who have dogs.<br><br>

                            (3) Nothing in this section shall limit the operation of section 20 in relation
                            to
                            discrimination on the ground of impairment.<br><br>

                            (4) This section does not affect the liability of a person with a Dog Guide for
                            any
                            damage caused by the Dog Guide.<br><br>

                            area around Alice Springs is covered by the Alice Springs Animal Control By-Law.
                            This
                            law provides exemptions from the normal dog requirements for guide, hearing and

                            In NSW laws are the same as the federal ones in regards for definitions of

                            animals and also for disability. State laws really reinforce those rights and

                            (2) The person is not guilty of an offence merely because the person takes the
                            animal
                            into or onto or permits the animal to enter or be in or on any such building or

                            defence to that prosecution that relies for its efficacy on the presence of the

                            person if
                            the person had not been accompanied by the animal.

                            accommodation for the animal additional to that supplied for the person, that
                            the charge
                            was imposed for that additional accommodation, and that the charge was a
                            reasonable

                            (b) the defendant reasonably incurred additional expense because of the presence
                            of the
                            animal, that the charge imposed was to recompense the defendant for that
                            additional
                            expense, and that the charge was a reasonable charge in the

                            charge
                            imposed on another person, the court may, upon application made by that other

                            (4) The court’s order operates as an order for the payment of money under the
                            Civil
                            Procedure Act 2005 and is enforceable as such an order under that Act. The order

                            made,
                            in such manner as may be prescribed by rules made under that Act.<br><br>

                            to be a characteristic that appertains generally to persons who have that
                            disability,

                            Disability discrimination occurs when a person is treated less favourably, or not given
                            the same opportunities as others in a similar situation because of their disability.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            The Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (DDA) makes it unlawful to discriminate against a
                            person, in many areas of public life, including employment, education, getting or using
                            services, renting or buying a house or unit, and accessing public places, because of
                            their disability.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            The DDA covers people who have temporary and permanent disabilities; physical,
                            intellectual, sensory, neurological, learning and psychosocial disabilities, diseases or
                            illnesses, physical disfigurement, medical conditions, and work-related injuries.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            It extends to disabilities that people have had in the past and potential future
                            disabilities, as well as disabilities that people are assumed to have.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            The DDA protects people with disabilities who may be discriminated against because they
                            are accompanied by an assistant, interpreter or reader; they are accompanied by a
                            trained animal, such as a guide, hearing or assistance dog; or they use equipment or an
                            aid, such as a wheelchair or a hearing aid.
